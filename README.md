# ![hashids](http://hashids.org/public/img/hashids-logo-normal.png "Hashids")

The [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) port of the [Hashids](http://hashids.org/) library.

## Some Documentation

A small C library to generate Youtube-like IDs from one or many numbers.
Use __Hashids__ when you don't want to expose your database IDs to the user.

Read more about the library at [http://hashids.org/c/](http://hashids.org/c/).

## Building

The C port has become (since version 1.1.0) a regular [autotools](https://autotools.io/)-built library.
You can build it easily, provided you have `autoconf`, `automake` and other `autotools` stuff installed:

``` bash
./bootstrap
./configure
make
# make install-strip
```

## Usage

The C usage differs marginally than [JavaScript's](http://hashids.org/javascript/) or [Ruby's](http://hashids.org/ruby/) in the matter that nothing is done (automagically) for you.
You'll have to manually allocate and free all memory you need for encoding/decoding.
The library itself will only allocate the `hashids_t` structure (the _handle_) on its own.
If you want to roll your own allocator, [look here](#memory-allocation).

### API

The C version of Hashids works (presumably, and only) with `unsigned long long` arguments.
Negative (signed) integers are, by design, treated as very big unsigned ones.

Note: The API has changed a bit since version `1.1.0`. `hashids_t` is now a type alias of `struct hashids_t`.
Note: Since version `1.2.0` `hashids_decode` has a 4th parameter for bounds checking.

#### Preamble

A small header (`hashids.h`) is installed in `${PREFIX}/include`.
All further examples (unless explicitly shown otherwise) use empty salt for initializations.

``` c
#include <hashids.h>
hashids_t hashids;
hashids = hashids_init(NULL);
```

#### hashids_free

``` c
void
hashids_free(hashids_t *hashids);
```

The 'destructor'. This function disposes what you can allocate with the following 3 functions.
You'll definetely need to call this function when you're done (un)hashing.

#### hashids_init4

``` c
hashids_t *
hashids_init4(const char *salt, size_t min_hash_length, const char *alphabet, const char *separators);
```

The most common initializer.

Example:

``` c
hashids_t *hashids;
hashids = hashids_init4("this is my salt", 0, HASHIDS_DEFAULT_ALPHABET, HASHIDS_DEFAULT_SEPARATORS);
```

#### hashids_init3

``` c
hashids_t *
hashids_init3(const char *salt, size_t min_hash_length, const char *alphabet);
```

The same as `hashids_init3` but without the `separators` parameter.
Will use `HASHIDS_DEFAULT_SEPARATORS` as alphabet.

Example:

``` c
hashids_t *hashids;
hashids = hashids_init3("this is my salt", 0, HASHIDS_DEFAULT_ALPHABET);
```

#### hashids_init2

``` c
hashids_t *
hashids_init2(const char *salt, size_t min_hash_length);
```

The same as `hashids_init3` but without the `alpabet` parameter.
Will use `HASHIDS_DEFAULT_ALPHABET` as alphabet.

#### hashids_init

``` c
hashids_t *
hashids_init(const char *salt);
```

The same as `hashids_init2` but using `0` as `min_hash_length`.
If you pass `NULL` for `salt` the `HASHIDS_DEFAULT_SALT` will be used (currently `""`).

#### hashids_estimate_encoded_size

``` c
size_t
hashids_estimate_encoded_size(hashids_t *hashids, size_t numbers_count, unsigned long long *numbers);
```

Since we have no idea how much bytes an encoded `ULONGLONG` will take, there's this (pessimistic) function:

Example:

``` c
unsigned long long numbers[] = {1ull, 2ull, 3ull, 4ull, 5ull};
size_t bytes_needed;
bytes_needed = hashids_estimate_encoded_size(hashids, sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(unsigned long long), numbers);
/* bytes_needed => 12 */
```

#### hashids_estimate_encoded_size_v

``` c
size_t
hashids_estimate_encoded_size_v(hashids_t *hashids, size_t numbers_count, ...);
```

The variadic variant of the `hashids_estimate_encoded_size` function.

Example:

``` c
bytes_needed = hashids_estimate_encoded_size_v(hashids, 5, 1ull, 2ull, 3ull, 4ull, 5ull);
/* bytes_needed => 12 */
```

#### hashids_encode

``` c
size_t
hashids_encode(hashids_t *hashids, char *buffer, size_t numbers_count, unsigned long long *numbers);
```

The common encoding encoder.
Encodes an array of `ULONGLONG` numbers.
The returned value is the count of bytes encoded - if 0, something went south...

Example:

``` c
size_t bytes_encoded;
char hash[512];
unsigned long long numbers[] = {1ull};
bytes_encoded = hashids_encode(hashids, hash, sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(unsigned long long), numbers);
/* hash => "jR", bytes_encoded => 2 */
unsigned long long numbers2[] = {1ull, 2ull, 3ull, 4ull, 5ull};
bytes_encoded = hashids_encode(hashids, hash, sizeof(numbers2) / sizeof(unsigned long long), numbers2);
/* hash => "ADf9h9i0sQ", bytes_encoded => 10 */
```

#### hashids_encode_v

``` c
size_t
hashids_encode_v(hashids_t *hashids, char *buffer, size_t numbers_count, ...);
```

The variadic variant of `hashids_encode`.

Example:

``` c
bytes_encoded = hashids_encode_v(hashids, hash, 1, 1ull);
/* hash => "jR", bytes_encoded => 2 */
bytes_encoded = hashids_encode_v(hashids, hash, 5, 1ull, 2ull, 3ull, 4ull, 5ull);
/* hash => "ADf9h9i0sQ", bytes_encoded => 10 */
```

#### hashids_encode_one

``` c
size_t
hashids_encode_one(hashids_t *hashids, char *buffer, unsigned long long number);
```

A shorthand function encoding just one `ULONGLONG`.

Example:

``` c
bytes_encoded = hashids_encode_one(hashids, hash, 12345);
/* hash => "j0gW", bytes_encoded => 4 */
```

#### hashids_numbers_count

``` c
size_t
hashids_numbers_count(hashids_t *hashids, const char *str);
```

Returns how many `ULONGLONG`s are encoded in a string.
If the function returns `0`, the hash is probably hashed with a different salt/alphabet.
It's up to you to allocate `result * sizeof(unsigned long long)` memory yourself.

Example:

``` c
size_t numbers_count = hashids_numbers_count(hashids, "ADf9h9i0sQ");
/* numbers_count => 5 */
```

#### hashids_decode

``` c
size_t
hashids_decode(hashids_t *hashids, const char *str, unsigned long long *numbers, size_t numbers_max);
```

The common decoding decoder.
Will decode a string hash to an array of `ULONGLONG`s with a limit check.
If you pass `NULL` as output or `0` as limit, the number count will be returned.
If the function returns `0`, the hash is probably hashed with a different salt/alphabet.

Example:

``` c
unsigned long long numbers[5];
result = hashids_decode(hashids, "QkoW1vt955nxCVVjZDt5VD2PTgBP72", numbers, 5);
/* numbers = {21979508, 35563591, 57543099, 93106690, 150649789}, result => 5 */
```

#### hashids_decode_unsafe

``` c
size_t
hashids_decode_unsafe(hashids_t *hashids, const char *str, unsigned long long *numbers);
```

The unsafe decoding decoder. Kept mostly for the ease of use.
Will decode a string hash to an array of `ULONGLONG`s with **no** boundary checks.

Example:

``` c
unsigned long long numbers[5];
result = hashids_decode_unsafe(hashids, "QkoW1vt955nxCVVjZDt5VD2PTgBP72", numbers);
/* numbers = {21979508, 35563591, 57543099, 93106690, 150649789}, result => 5 */
```

#### hashids_decode_safe

A "safe" decoding decoder. Checks if the decoded numbers are encoded into the exact same string.

Example:

``` c
hashids_t hashids;
hashids = hashids_init3(HASHIDS_DEFAULT_SALT, 64, HASHIDS_DEFAULT_ALPHABET);
unsigned long long numbers[5];
result = hashids_decode_safe(hashids, "ky16BrZ5DYW4q3oOaQkoW1vt955nxCVVjZDt5VD2PTgBP72dKAMmwRnQXlEgGJ2p", numbers, 5);
/* result => 0, hashids_errno = HASHIDS_ERROR_INVALID_HASH (the correct last letter is "P") */
XXXXXX
```

#### hashids_encode_hex

``` c
size_t
hashids_encode_hex(hashids_t *hashids, char *buffer, const char *hex_str);
```

Encodes a hex string rather than a number.

Example:

``` c
bytes_encoded = hashids_encode_hex(hashids, hash, "C0FFEE");
/* hash => "k7AVov", result => 6 */
```

#### hashids_decode_hex

``` c
size_t
hashids_decode_hex(hashids_t *hashids, char *str, char *output);
```

Decodes a hash to a hex string rather than to a number.

Example:

``` c
char str[18];   /* sizeof(unsigned long long) * 2 + 2 */
result = hashids_decode_hex(hashids, "k7AVov", str);
/* str => "C0FFEE", result => 1 */
```

## Error checking

The library uses its own `extern int hashids_errno` for error handling, thus it does not mangle the system-wide `errno`.
`hashids_errno` definitions:

| CONSTANT                              | Code  | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| __HASHIDS_ERROR_OK__                  |     0 | Happy, do nothing!                                                    |
| __HASHIDS_ERROR_ALLOC__               |    -1 | Memory allocation error                                               |
| __HASHIDS_ERROR_ALPHABET_LENGTH__     |    -2 | The alphabet is shorter than `HASHIDS_MIN_ALPHABET_LENGTH` (16 chars) |
| __HASHIDS_ERROR_ALPHABET_SPACE__      |    -3 | The alphabet contains a space (tab NOT included)                      |
| __HASHIDS_ERROR_INVALID_HASH__        |    -4 | An invalid hash has been passed to `hashids_decode()`                 |
| __HASHIDS_ERROR_INVALID_NUMBER__      |    -5 | An invalid hex string has been passed to `hashids_encode_hex()`       |

Since `v1.1.5` `hashids_errno` is thread-safe.

## Memory allocation

Since the `hashids_init*` (and some of the `*_v`) functions are memory-dependent, this library is trying to be allocator-agnostic.
If you roll your own allocator, or for some reason you don't like external libraries calling `malloc`/`calloc`, you can redefine the memory handling functions:

``` c
void *(*_hashids_alloc)(size_t size)    = hashids_alloc_f;
void (*_hashids_free)(void *ptr)        = hashids_free_f;
```

Please note that the `hashids_init*` functions (most likely) rely on zero-initialized memory.

## CLI

The library also has a command line utility providing all the functionality in the shell.

The usage is not much different. If you have any trouble, just run the command without any arguments and read the help lines.

``` bash
./hashids 1
# => jR
./hashids -d jR
# => 1
```

You can also consult the source (`main.c`) for further help on using `hashids`.
